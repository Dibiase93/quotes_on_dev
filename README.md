# Quotes on Dev\_

This is my 5th project at RED, it had lots of challenging jQuery where I got to work with Ajax post and Ajax get requests.

##### Instructions

This is a Wordpress Theme, please go to wp-content/themes and find quotes_on_dev.

## Learning Curve

It was very challenging at first, working with the data from the Ajax request. This project gave me a chance to work with jQuery alot and it helped me get a better understanding of how working with data is like. We created an on click event that generates a random quote.

### Challenges

I had the most issues with the jQuery part of the project. However, I thought I had a good understanding of CSS, but this project had some challenging CSS. Also, I underestimated how long it would take to style the 404 and search page, so didn't have time to fully finish them.

#### Getting started

Download files, and open through WordPress.
